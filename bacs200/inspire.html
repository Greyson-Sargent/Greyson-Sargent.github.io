<p>My inpiration is Kobe Bryant, the Black Mamba. His unmatched work ethic and determination inpired me as a young basketball fan. Not only was Kobe dominate on the basketball floor, but he was dedicated to helping others in many aspects of life. His passing this year was tragic not only to the basketball community, but also to anyone who knew how he approached challenges in life. He's a hero in every aspect of life.</p>
